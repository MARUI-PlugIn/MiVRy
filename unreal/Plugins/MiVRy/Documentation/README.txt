### Introduction:
Making good user interaction for VR is hard. The number of buttons often isn't enough and memorizing button combinations is challenging for users.
Gestures are a great solution! Allow your users to wave their 3D controllers like a magic want and have wonderful things happening. Draw an arrow to shoot a magic missile, make a spiral to summon a hurricane, shake your controller to reload your gun, or just swipe left and right to "undo" or "redo" previous operations.

MARUI has many years of experience of creating VR/AR/XR user interfaces for 3D design software.
Now YOU can use its powerful gesture recognition module in Unity.

This is a highly advanced artificial intelligence that can learn to understand your 3D controller motions.
The gestures can be both direction specific ("swipe left" vs. "swipe right") or direction independent ("draw an arrow facing in any direction") - either way, you will receive the direction, position, and scale at which the user performed the gesture!
Draw a large 3d cube and there it will appear, with the appropriate scale and orientation.


### Key features:
- Real 3D gestures - like waving a magic wand in all three dimensions
- Support for multi-part gesture combinations such as two-handed gestures or sequential combinations of gestures
- Record your own gestures - simple and straightforward
- Easy to use, Blueprint-ready actor classes
- Can have multiple sets of gestures simultaneously (for example: different sets of gestures for different buttons)
- High recognition fidelity
- Outputs the position, scale, and orientation at which the gesture was performed
- High performance (back-end written in optimized C/C++)
- Save gestures to file for later loading
