# MiVRy 3D Gesture Recognition AI
Copyright (c) 2020 MARUI-PlugIn (inc.)

MiVRy is an artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn to detect and distinguish motion patterns. It is aimed at human gesture recognition and can be trained to understand gestures such as a *"come here"* wave, performing a dance move, using tactical signs and gestures as used by military and police or you very own secret sign language.

It is cross-platform and can be used with any VR device, mobile device (phone, smart watch) or with camera-based tracking systems (kinect).
